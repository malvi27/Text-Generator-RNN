# Text Generator

## Overview
This project implements a text generation model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with PyTorch. The model learns from a provided corpus of text and can generate sentences based on the patterns it has learned.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and tokenizes input text, creating a vocabulary for the model.
- **RNN Model**: A custom implementation of an RNN for generating text.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Trains the model using backpropagation and evaluates its performance.
- **Visualization**: Plots training loss over epochs.
